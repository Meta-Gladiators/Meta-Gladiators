# AI Agent - MetaGladiators

## Overview
The AI Agent module is responsible for training, evolving, and managing AI Gladiators in MetaGladiators.  
Each Gladiator is powered by **reinforcement learning, strategic AI models, and real-time battle simulations**.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning**: AI trains itself through battle experiences.
- **Strategic Adaptation**: AI dynamically adjusts combat behavior based on previous fights.
- **Customizable AI Models**: Players can upgrade AI Gladiators to optimize their performance.

## Installation
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Train a new AI Gladiator:
   ```bash
   python ai_agent/train.py
   ```

3. Run battle simulations:
   ```bash
   python ai_agent/battle_simulator.py
   ```

## AI Training Pipeline
1. **Data Collection**: AI collects battle history and training data.
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: AI refines its strategies through self-play.
3. **Simulation & Testing**: The AI agent fights in simulated battles.
4. **Performance Optimization**: AI adapts its combat behavior dynamically.

## Contribution Guide
- Submit AI model improvements in `train.py` and `strategy_engine.py`.
- AI Gladiator updates should be thoroughly tested before PR submission.
- Use `pretrained_models/` to store validated AI models.
